         <h3>About me</h3>
            <p>I am a full stack web developer, musician and session drummer based in Berlin with a background in NGO sector and social sciences.</p>
            <p>Since I feel most motivated and my most authentic self when I can solve hands-on tasks and deliver solutions based on all the resources and knowledge available, I am passionate about coding. Currently I am looking for an opportunity to grow my full stack development skills in an impactful and collaborative environment. Iâ€™m enthusiastic to apply my acquired skills to create stunning user experiences by working on versatile projects across teams. Being a self-motivated learner and having a natural curiosity about programming, I am very eager to learn new technologies too.</p>
